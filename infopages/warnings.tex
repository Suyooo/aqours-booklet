\small Do not take any photos or record video and/or audio of the screening. This could not only lead to you being banned from the location, but also hurt the chances of more Delayed Viewings coming to overseas locations.\\
{\footnotesize The Japanese entertainment industry is very protective of their material. Please respect the creators by not taking pictures, and also tell others to stop recording if you see them doing so!}

\small "Yakkai" (Japanese for "nuisance" or "obnoxious") describes any calls or actions with the sole intention of disrupting or annoying other attendees. Because they are banned at concerts, they're also not welcome at any screenings.\\
{\footnotesize "Yakkai" includes (but is not limited to) mixes, tigering, modded penlights, KB fans and physically obstructing others.}
