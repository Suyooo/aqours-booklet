\def\pagetitletext{Call Guides}

The following chapter contains not only the lyrics, but also the \textbf{call guides} for every song in today's screening. A call guide contains information on where and when to use each type of chant introduced before, so attendees are aware of which calls the majority of the audience will be using.\\

The guides are color-coded for your convenience:\\
\calltext{Red text} are chants, such as Hai Chants, Fu Chants or PPPHs.\\
\sing{Blue text} marks lyrics to sing along to.\\
\claptext{Green text} marks parts of the song to clap to - refer to the notes next to the text to find out the pattern or speed to use.\\
Finally, {\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}\colorbox{chika!30}{\strut{text with a background color}}} is used for any other kind of instruction, such as light color changes or other member-specific instructions.\\

If you have any questions, feel free to ask other attendees - and remember, there is no correct way to call! The call guides in this booklet only include the most common calls and chants used in the lives. As long as you go along with the beat and the mood of the song, you can't go wrong!\\

\textbf{Aqours \& Saint Snow UCA - \textcolor{aqours}{aqoursuca.jimdo.com}}\\
The Unofficial Call Account is a Japanese site, but one of the most complete collections of callguides, and very frequently updated. They're also very active on Twitter in order to find changes in calls from concert-goers and LV attendees, or run polls on possible updates.
